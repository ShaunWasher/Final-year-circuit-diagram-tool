# Final-year-circuit-diagram-tool
my final year project, this holds all my work for a learning tool for physics GCSE/A-Level students

The easiest way to run this locally is by using docker, it is available on dockerhub under shaunwasher/circuitsim

Otherwise, It can be run on IIS (Internet Information services) but you must install the .NET SDK from 
Microsoft online.
