# Final-year-circuit-diagram-tool

- my final year project, this holds all my work for a circuit simulation learning tool for physics GCSE/A-Level students
- The easiest way to run this locally is by using docker, it is available on dockerhub under shaunwasher/circuitsim
- otherwise it can be ran through visual studio 2022
